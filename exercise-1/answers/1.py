# Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format (see the output).
# String : 
# "It was the best of times, 
#      it was the worst of times. 
#  It was the age of wisdom, 
#      it was the age of foolishness.
#  It was the epoch of belief, 
#      it was the epoch of incredulity. 
#  It was the season of light, 
#      it was the season of darkness. 
#  It was the spring of hope, 
#      it was the winter of despair.
# Note: You will need to know that "\n" starts a new line, and "\t" tabs the text that follows - try it!
