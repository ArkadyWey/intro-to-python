# Write a python program containing a for loop 
# to count the number of times the number 1 appears in a given random 
# list of numbers 

# Hint: 
# Uncomment the folliwing code to generate a list of 1s and 0s:
# Try to understand how this works!

# import random
# number_list = [0]*random.randint(0,10) + [1]*random.randint(0,20) 
# random.shuffle(number_list)
# print(number_list)
