# Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of 
# comma-separated numbers from the user and 
# generates a list and a tuple of those numbers. 

# Example: 
# Sample data : 3, 5, 7, 23
# Output :
# [3, 5, 7, 23]

# Hint: You will need to use:
# split, which is a method on lists. 
# a while loop
# type conversion
# pop, which is another method on lists. 
# append, which is another method on lists. 
# Google these!
