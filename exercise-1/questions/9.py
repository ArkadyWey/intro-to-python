# Write a Python program that determines whether each number 
# in a series of numbers separated by a comma 
# (accepted from the user) is even or odd, 
# and prints an appropriate message to the user.

# Hint: 
# Use if statements and a while loop. 
# You might also need len(), which calculates the length of a list, 
# and pop(), which gets the next element of a list.
# An alternative is to use a for loop instead of a while loop - these are very important, 
# look these up, or see the solutions 
# for an answer using a for loop.
